# Capstoneproject_LITA
My project when learning data analysis with the incubator hub

In this project, I am analyzing the sales performance of a retail store. To explore sales data to uncover key insights such as top-selling products, regional performance, and monthly sales trends. The goal is to produce an interactive Power BI dashboard that highlights these findings.
